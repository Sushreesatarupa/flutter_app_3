# Dicee ðŸŽ²

## Goal
 to make apps with functionality using setState() inside Stateful Flutter widgets.

## What you will create

I created a dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button. With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be able to settle any score on the go!

## What I learned

- Flutter stateless widgets to design the user interface.
- Flutter stateful widgets to update the user interface.
- change the properties of various widgets.
- use onPressed listeners to detect when buttons are pressed.
- use setState to mark the widget tree as dirty and requiring update on the next render.
- use Expanded to make widgets adapt to screen dimensions.
- use string interpolation.
- dart programming concepts such as data types and functions.
- gesture controls.
